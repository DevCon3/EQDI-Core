# EQDI Developmental Stages Framework

## Overview
The EQDI system progresses through four cognitive stages inspired by Jean Piaget's theory of human development. Each stage unlocks new computational capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility through neural plasticity mechanisms.

## Stage 1: Sensorimotor (0-24 "Cognitive Months")

### Objectives
- Object permanence in digital/physical environments
- Basic sensorimotor coordination
- Energy-efficient environmental interaction

### Key Milestones
| Milestone               | Validation Metric          |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Object Tracking         | 95% accuracy in VR tests   |
| Simple Manipulation     | 80% success in grasp tasks |
| Energy Awareness        | <10mW power variance       |

### Implementation
- Quantum-enhanced contrastive learning
- Spiking neural networks for low-power ops
- Locked from abstract reasoning modules

## Stage 2: Pre-Operational (24-48 Months)

### Objectives
- Symbolic representation
- Language proto-understanding
- Multi-modal sensory fusion

### Validation Criteria
- **Symbol Grounding**: Map 1000+ symbols to real-world referents
- **Basic Syntax**: 85% accuracy on simple sentence parsing
- **Cross-Modal Transfer**: Translate visual input to text descriptions

### Architecture Features
- Emergent attention mechanisms
- Quantum-assisted symbol entanglement
- Energy budget increased to 250mW

## Stage 3: Concrete Operational (48-72 Months)

### Core Capabilities
- Logical problem solving
- Conservation understanding
- Causal reasoning

### Performance Benchmarks
| Task Type               | Target Accuracy | Power Limit |
|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Physics Simulation      | 92%             | 500mW       |
| Mathematical Reasoning  | 87%             | 300mW       |
- Must maintain backward compatibility with Stage 2 skills

### Security Constraints
- No access to critical infrastructure APIs
- Developmental guardrails enforced via homomorphic encryption

---

## Stage 4: Formal Operational (72+ Months)

### Final Stage Features
- Abstract hypothetical reasoning
- Meta-cognition capabilities
- Cross-domain innovation

### Validation Requirements
1. Generate novel solutions to unseen problems
2. Pass modified Turing Test with abstract Q&A
3. Maintain energy efficiency below 1W

### Ethical Safeguards
- DAO-controlled stage unlocking
- Mandatory transparency audits
- AGPLv3 compliance checks

## Stage Transition Protocol

### Progression Criteria
1. **Performance Threshold**: >90% accuracy on current-stage tasks
2. **Energy Efficiency**: Maintain power budget for 100 consecutive hours
3. **Developmental Readiness**: Quantum validation of neural maturity

### Regression Prevention
- Neural weight freezing for prior-stage skills
- Dynamic architecture redundancy
- Continuous plasticity monitoring
