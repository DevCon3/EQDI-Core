# EQDI Architecture Overview

## System Overview
Eco-Quantum Developmental Intelligence (EQDI) is a decentralized AI framework that combines four revolutionary paradigms:
1. **Quantum-Enhanced Learning**
2. **Developmental Stage Progression**
3. **Energy-Aware Computation**
4. **Symbiotic Skill Markets**

## Core Components

### 1. Quantum Self-Organization (QSO)
**Purpose**: Parallel exploration of neural topologies using quantum effects  
**Tech Stack**:
- Qiskit/PennyLane for quantum circuits
- PyTorch Quantum for hybrid models
- Entanglement routing protocols

### 2. Developmental Stages
**Cognitive Progression**:
1. Sensorimotor (Object permanence)
2. Pre-Operational (Symbolic representation)  
3. Concrete Operational (Logical reasoning)  
4. Formal Operational (Abstract thinking)

**Implementation**:
- Stage-gated neural architecture
- Curriculum learning with progressive unlocking
- Dynamic pruning/growth of networks

### 3. Energy-Aware Computation
**Power Management**:
- Solar/vibration/thermal harvesting
- Reinforcement learning-based allocation
- Priority-based task scheduling

### 4. Symbiotic Skill Markets
**Decentralized Protocol**:
- Smart contracts for skill trading
- Tokenized compute credits
- Federated learning integration

## Cross-Component Interactions

### Quantum-Developmental Interface
- Quantum circuits generate neural blueprints
- Developmental stages control quantum decoherence
- Stage transitions triggered by quantum validation

### Energy-Adaptive Operation
| Energy State | Quantum Core | Developmental | Market |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| High (>10mW) | Full ops     | Active growth | Open   |
| Medium       | Sampled ops  | Fine-tuning   | Limited|
| Low (<1mW)   | Frozen       | Dormant       | Closed |

## Security & Ethics
1. **Quantum-Resistant Encryption**
2. **Decentralized Governance**
3. **Anti-Exploitation Measures**

## Roadmap

|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Quantum Core      | Basic entanglement  | Error-corrected ops   | Topology optimizer|
| Developmental     | Stage 1-2           | Stage 3               | Full progression  |
| Energy System     | Solar-only          | Vibration harvesting  | Full integration  |
| Markets           | Testnet             | Decentralized trading | DAO governance    |
