## üìú Overview

EQDI is an open-source initiative to create **self-sustaining, adaptive AI systems** that:
- **Learn through developmental stages** (like a child growing into an adult)
- **Harvest ambient energy** (solar, thermal, vibration) for computation
- **Innovate via quantum-chaotic exploration**
- **Collaborate through decentralized skill markets**

This repository is the **prototype implementation** of the EQDI vision. Join us to build intelligence that evolves in harmony with humanity and the planet.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Jupyter Lab
- Qiskit (for quantum components)
- Rust (for energy-aware modules)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DevCon3/EQDI-Core
cd EQDI-Core
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from eqdi import DevelopmentalAgent

# Initialize a quantum-enhanced agent
agent = DevelopmentalAgent(stage="sensorimotor")

# Train through developmental stages
while not agent.stage == "formal_operational":
    agent.learn(environment)
    agent.validate_performance()
```

## üìö Documentation

### Architecture Overview
The EQDI architecture is divided into four core modules:
1. **Quantum Self-Organization**: Uses quantum circuits to explore multiple neural topologies simultaneously.
2. **Developmental Stages**: Implements Piaget-inspired learning stages (sensorimotor ‚Üí formal operational).
3. **Energy-Aware Compute**: Dynamically adjusts power usage based on ambient energy availability.
4. **Symbiotic AI Markets**: Enables decentralized skill trading between agents.

### Developmental Curriculum
The developmental curriculum is designed to mimic human cognitive growth. Each stage unlocks new capabilities:
- **Sensorimotor**: Object permanence, basic motor skills.
- **Pre-Operational**: Symbolic representation, language understanding.
- **Concrete Operational**: Logical reasoning about concrete events.
- **Formal Operational**: Abstract thinking, hypothetical reasoning.

### Energy-Harvesting Design
The energy-harvesting module integrates:
- **Photovoltaic Nanowires**: Capture solar energy.
- **Piezoelectric MEMS**: Convert vibrations into electrical power.
- **Thermoelectric Grids**: Exploit thermal gradients.
